        about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.<br/><br/>

        <b>Personal Information Provided by You.</b> The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions
        with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect

            <li>email addresses</li>
            <li>mailing addresses</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Sensitive Information.</b> We do not process sensitive information.<br/><br/>

        <b>Payment Data.</b> We may collect data necessary to process your payment if you choose to make purchases, such as your payment
        instrument number, and the security code associated with your payment instrument. All payment data is handled and stored by Stripe.
        You may find their privacy notice link(s) here: https://stripe.com/gb/privacy. <br/><br/>

        All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

        <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
        <i><b>In Short:</b> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — 
        is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</i> <br/><br/>

        We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal
        your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address,
        browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information
        about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security
        and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.<br/><br/>

        The information we collect includes:

        <ul>
            <li><i>Log and Usage Data.</i> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers
                automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with
                us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity
                in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you
                take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called
                'crash dumps' ), and hardware settings).<br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li><i>Device Data.</i> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access
                the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device
                and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier,
                operating system, and system configuration information.<br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Location Data.</i> We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or
                imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example,
                we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You
                can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location
                setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="privacy2">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <i><b>In Short:</b> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud
        prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</i><br/><br/>

        <b>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</b>

            <li><b>To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.</b> We may process your information to respond to your inquiries and solve any

            vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="privacy3">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <i><b>In Short:</b> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis)
        to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual
        obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</i><br/><br/>

        <u><b><i>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</i></b></u><br/><br/>

        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal
        information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Consent.</b> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a
            specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</li><br/>
            <li><b>Performance of a Contract.</b> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual
            obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li><br/>
            <li><b>Legal Obligations.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations,
            such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information
            as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li><br/>
            <li><b>Vital Interests.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital
            interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li><br/>
        </ul>

        <u><b><i>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</i></b></u><br/><br/>

        We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
        purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.<br/><br/>

        In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
        <ul>
            <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li><br/>
            <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li><br/>
            <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li><br/>
            <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li><br/>
            <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li><br/>
            <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li><br/>
            <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
                collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a
                province</li><br/>
            <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li><br/>
            <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes
                for which the information was produced</li><br/>
            <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li><br/>
            <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li><br/>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="privacy4">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
            <i><b>In Short:</b> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</i> <br/><br/>

            We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Business Transfers.</b> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of
                company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
            </ul>
            

        <h2 id="privacy5">5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
            <i><b>In Short:</b> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</i><br/><br/>
            We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services.
            Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist
            with basic site functions.<br/><br/>

            We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including
            to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on
            your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services
            tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.<br/><br/>

            To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a 'sale'/'sharing' (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the
            applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below
            under section <a href="#privacy10">'DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?'</a><br/><br/>

            Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.
            
            <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
            We may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyse the use of the Services. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics
            across the Services, visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. For more information
            on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy & Terms page.</a>

        <h2 id="privacy6">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
            <i><b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</i><br/><br/>

            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention
            period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).<br/><br/>

            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or,
            if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
            information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

        <h2 id="privacy7">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
            <i><b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</i> <br/><br/>

            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
            information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
            information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
            unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
            we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.
            You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

        <h2 id="privacy8">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
            <i><b>In Short:</b> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom
            (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review,
            change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</i> <br/><br/>

            In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws.
            These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification
            or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not
            to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of
            your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
            <a href="#privacy13">'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?'</a> below.<br/><br/>

            We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.<br/><br/>
 
            If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right
            to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.<br/><br/>

            If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.<br/><br/>

            <b><u>Withdrawing your consent:</u></b> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or
            implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your
            consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
            <a href="#privacy13">'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?'</a> below. <br/><br/>

            However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law
            allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. <br/><br/>

            If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at sherlockholmesyorkimaginarium@gmail.com.

        <h2 id="privacy9">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can
            activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage,
            no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
            browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
            tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice. <br/><br/>

            California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
            standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

        <h2 id="privacy10">10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
            <i><b>In Short:</b>If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota,
            Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request
            access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get
            a copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information.
            These rights may be limited in some circumstances by applicable law. More information is provided below.</i>             
            <h3>Categories of Personal Information We Collect</h3>
